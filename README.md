### What I learned

In this project i learned:
- To implement react hooks
- Use the useState and useEffect hooks
- Using function components instead of class components
- Javascript destructuring when passing props and to map in an array of objects

```js
const Header = () => {
    let images = [mobile_image_1, mobile_image_2, mobile_image_3]
    const [value, setValue] = useState('none');
    const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

    const prevClick = () => {
      setIndex(index === 0 ? images.length - 1 : index - 1)
    }
    const nextClick = useCallback(() => {
      setIndex(index === images.length - 1 ? 0 : index + 1)
    }, [images.length, index])

    useEffect(() => {
      let interval = setInterval(nextClick, 5000);
      return () => clearInterval(interval);
    }, [index, nextClick]);

    return <header>
    <div className='nav_container'>
      <figure className='burger_and_logo_container'>
        <img src={burger} alt="" className='burger' onClick={() => setValue('flex')}/>
        <img src={logo} alt="" />
      </figure>
      <nav className='navbar' style={{display: value}}>
          <figure className='close_container'>
            <img src={close} alt="" onClick={()=> setValue('none')} />
          </figure>
          <ul>
            <li>Home</li>
            <li>Shop</li>
            <li>About</li>
            <li>Contact</li>
          </ul>
        </nav>
    </div>
    <div className='images_container'>
      <ShowCurrentImage images={images} index={index}/>
      <div className='arrows_container'>
        <div className='arrow left' onClick={prevClick}></div>
        <div className='arrow right' onClick={nextClick}></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div className='header_article_container'>
    <ShowCurrentArticle index={index} />
            {/*<h2>Discover innovative ways to decorate</h2>

            <div className='button_container'>
              <button>Shop now</button><img src={arrow} alt="right incon arrow" />
            </div>
        </div>
  </header>
}
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
